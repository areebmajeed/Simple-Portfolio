SIMPLE PORTFOLIO PHP SCRIPT v1
/* The script is open source, means you're free to use it anywhere without any special previliges. */


This is a simple portfolio script which enables you to show off your work. Basically, this was designed for designers, the people who want to showcase their designs. 


What the script comes with : 

1) A database import with all the tables required.
2) A config file, located at : ../config/config.php
3) An simple admin system which allows you to upload the images, add title, description, abouts, etc.
4) A profile page (still incomplete)
5) Replace the logo by replacing "sample-watermark.png" here : ../assets/default/images/sample-watermark.png (Keep in mind to keep the same name or else it won't work. Will make a logo changer script in next versions.)
6) Social media information (For now, you'd have to edit the _footer.php, but I promise I will make add this feature in admin panel in next update.)
7) About Me page, "aboutme.php"
8) Hire Me page, "hireme.php"
9) Pages for Logos, Banners and Posters. (To edit this, you need to edit _header.php, and then again, I will add this in admin panel in next update.)
10) Bootstrap theme.
11) Register/Login feature.
12) and more

The script is in its initial stages right now, and I wanted to share it with you, so that we could work together. Let me know what you think of it.
