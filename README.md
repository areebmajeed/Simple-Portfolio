# SIMPLE PORTFOLIO PHP SCRIPT v0.1
======
 The script is open source, means you're free to use it anywhere without any special previliges. 


This is a simple portfolio script which enables you to show off your work. Basically, this was designed for designers, the people who want to showcase their designs. 


**What the script comes with : **

* A database import with all the tables required.
* A config file, located at : ../config/config.php
* An simple admin system which allows you to upload the images, add title, description, abouts, etc.
* A profile page (still incomplete)
* Replace the logo by replacing "sample-watermark.png" here : ../assets/default/images/sample-watermark.png (Keep in mind to keep the same name or else it won't work. Will make a logo changer script in next versions.)
* Social media information (For now, you'd have to edit the _footer.php, but I promise I will make add this feature in admin panel in next update.)
* About Me page, "aboutme.php"
* Hire Me page, "hireme.php"
* Pages for Logos, Banners and Posters. (To edit this, you need to edit _header.php, and then again, I will add this in admin panel in next update.)
* Bootstrap theme.
* Register/Login feature.
* and more

The script is in its initial stages right now, and I wanted to share it with you, so that we could work together. Let me know what you think of it.
