Hello there, <br>

I am Hardik, nice to meet you. Basically, I am a freelancer for graphic designing. I've served several clients with happy faces and I seek to serve more. <br>
Actually, I've a deep devotion towards graphics and have been doing it since the age of 13. I do various kinds of logos, banners, posters, etc.<br> 
<br>
My freelancing experience has been awesome so far. But the major problem has been the limitations on my designs. That's why I've coded myself this portfolio in PHP to showcase my designs.
<b><br><br>What I offer : <br><br>
• Quality work<br>

• 100% customer satisfaction<br>

• Several revisions on the project<br>

• PSD on demand<br>

• Vectors on demand<br>

• Various services<br>

• Multiple versions on demand<br>

• and.. free hugs!  :D<br>
